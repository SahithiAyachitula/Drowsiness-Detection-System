Drowsiness Detection System
This project implements a drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, Keras, and Pygame. It detects if a driver is feeling drowsy by monitoring the state of their eyes (open or closed) and triggers an alarm if the driver appears to be falling asleep.

*Features*
Real-time video capture and processing
Face and eye detection using Haar cascades
Eye state classification using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Alarm sound when the driver is detected to be drowsy
Visual display of the detection status and drowsiness score

*Requirements*
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Keras
TensorFlow
NumPy
Pygame
